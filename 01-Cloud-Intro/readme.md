# Cloud Introduction

> Foundations you need before diving into AWS.

## 🌩️ What is Cloud?
Cloud computing is the **delivery of IT resources (compute, storage, networking, databases, analytics, etc.) over the internet** with **pay-as-you-go pricing**.

### Why?
- No need to buy and maintain expensive hardware.
- Scale up/down based on demand.
- Focus on business, not infrastructure.

### When?
- Startups → Launch quickly without upfront capital.
- Enterprises → Modernize applications, reduce costs, innovate faster.
- Students/learners → Practice on-demand, temporary resources.

### Where?
- Global cloud providers like **AWS, Azure, GCP**, with multiple regions across the world.

### Example:
- Netflix → Runs its video streaming on AWS to serve millions of users globally.
- A student → Spins up an EC2 instance for a Python project and deletes it when done.

**Outcome:** Flexible, scalable, cost-efficient infrastructure available instantly.

## 🏗️ Service Models
Three major models:

### 1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Raw compute, storage, networking resources.
- You manage OS, applications, data.
- **Example:** AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Azure VM.  
**Use Case:** Hosting custom applications, experimenting with OS-level control.  
**Outcome:** Maximum flexibility, but more responsibility.

### 2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Pre-built environment for app development.
- Provider manages OS, runtime, scaling.
- **Example:** AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine.  
**Use Case:** Developers who just want to push code without managing infra.  
**Outcome:** Faster development cycles.

### 3. Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Fully managed apps accessible over internet.
- You just use the software.
- **Example:** Gmail, Zoom, Salesforce.  
**Use Case:** Businesses wanting ready-to-use software.  
**Outcome:** No infra headaches, pay per user or subscription.

## 🌍 Deployment Models
Different ways cloud can be deployed:

- **Public Cloud** → Services offered to anyone over internet.  
  *Example: AWS, Azure, GCP.*  
  ✅ Scalable, cost-effective.  
  ❌ Less control.  

- **Private Cloud** → Dedicated cloud infra for one organization.  
  *Example: VMware vSphere on-premises.*  
  ✅ High security, control.  
  ❌ Expensive.  

- **Hybrid Cloud** → Mix of public + private.  
  *Example: Sensitive workloads on private, scale-out workloads on AWS.*  
  ✅ Balance of cost & control.  

- **Multi-Cloud** → Using multiple providers.  
  *Example: AWS for storage, Azure for AI services.*  
  ✅ Avoid vendor lock-in.  
  ❌ Complexity in management.

## 🔐 Shared Responsibility Model
Cloud security is **shared** between **provider** and **customer**:

- **Provider (AWS, Azure, GCP)** → Responsible for security **of** the cloud  
  (Data center, hardware, global network, physical security).

- **Customer (You)** → Responsible for security **in** the cloud  
  (Configuring IAM, managing OS patches, encrypting data, securing apps).

**Example:**  
- AWS secures EC2 infrastructure.  
- You must configure your EC2 instance firewall (Security Groups).  

**Outcome:** Secure workloads when both parties play their role.

## ⚖️ Benefits & Trade-offs
**Benefits:**
- Elasticity → Scale up/down instantly.  
- Agility → Deploy apps globally in minutes.  
- Cost savings → Pay only for usage.  
- Reliability → Multi-AZ and global backups.  

**Trade-offs:**
- Less visibility compared to on-prem infra.  
- Vendor lock-in if using only one provider.  
- Learning curve for teams.

🎯 Objectives
 Understand core cloud concepts.

 Learn models: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS.

 Explore deployment models.

 Understand shared responsibility.

🛠️ Prerequisites
Curiosity + internet connection.

AWS Free Tier account (with IAM + MFA enabled).

Basic knowledge of IT (servers, networking).

📝 Notes
Cloud ≠ magic; it’s still servers, but managed by provider.

Always calculate cost before deploying.

Security is a shared responsibility.

🧪 Lab
Lab 1: Sign up for AWS Free Tier
Go to https://aws.amazon.com/free.

Create an account (don’t use root user daily).

Set up MFA for security.

Outcome: You now have a secure AWS Free Tier account.
