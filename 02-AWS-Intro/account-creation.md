This guide compares them side-by-side and explains how to create your accounts.

## 🟠 AWS Free Plan (New Rules in 2025)

- **Accounts before July 15, 2025:**  
  - ✅ **12-month Free Tier** + Always-Free services.  
  - ⚠️ After 12 months → pay-as-you-go billing.  

- **Accounts created on/after July 15, 2025:**  
  - ✅ **6 months Free Plan** OR until credits are used.  
  - 🎁 **$100 signup credits** + **up to $100 earned credits** (for completing tasks).  
  - ⏳ After expiry → account closed, 90-day data retention.  

**Always Free Examples (with usage limits):**  
- Lambda (1M requests/month)  
- DynamoDB (25 GB storage)  
- S3 (5 GB storage)

### 📝 What You Need for AWS Account
1. **Email ID** (not previously used for AWS).  
2. **Debit/Credit Card** (Visa/Mastercard/RuPay International works).

4. **Billing Address** (must match card address).  
5. **PAN/KYC** – not required at signup, but may be needed later.
